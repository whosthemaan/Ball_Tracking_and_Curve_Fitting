<!-- The steps to run the following code involves two very basic steps: -->
<!-- All the libraries used in my code are standard libraries including numpy, matplotlib, pandas and cv2 -->

1. Go to the project directory

<!-- //This generates two images, one with the red ball threshold done and another where curve fitting has been performed -->
2. python3 Problem_1.py 

 <!-- //This generates 3 figures, each of which contain side to side comparison of output from Standard Least Square, Total Least Square and RANSAC -->
3. python3 Problem_2.py
